 0.2    first version to CRAN
 0.2-1  fixed bugs in docs found by scripts on CRAN (R-devel check)
 0.3    added data/echinacea.txt
              man/echinacea.Rd
              test/tutor.R
        added test in aster.R
        added package vignette
        added examples on all help pages to be used by users
 0.3-1  changed variable "site" to "pop" in echinacea.txt
        corresponding changes in many other files
        \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} in tutor.Rnw
        many small changes in wording in tutor.Rnw
 0.4    made trust the default optimizer
 0.4-1  removed the timing.pdf vignette, fixed xrefs to trust in Rd files
 0.4-2  added import(trust) to NAMESPACE
 0.5    added 4-th family "two.trunc.poisson"
        actually implemented code for k-truncated Poisson
        put document describing k-truncated Poisson in inst/doc
        new R function rktp that simulates k-truncated Poisson
        cannot implement k-truncated Poisson for arbitrary family
              until families get (non-exponential family) parameters,
              such as k for k-truncated Poisson, r for negative binomial,
              offset for Poisson, n for binomial(n, p), sigma for
              normal-location.  All of that goes on the to-do list,
              along with multivariate families (as per revised version of
              the paper), especially multinomial and normal-location-scale.
        fixed (?!) or at least worked around nasty validation bug in
              predict.aster
 0.5-1  fixed bug in tests/tutor.R caused by bug fix in R.  optim was ignoring
            its maxit argument when method == "CG".  When it stopped ignoring
            it, it failed to converge, because it takes more than 1000
            iterations.
 0.5-2  fixed bug in inst/doc/trunc.Rnw -- must be vignette to pass R CMD check
